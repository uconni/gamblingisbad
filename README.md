Here's Why
by Corey Nguyen

In the realm of charitable acts, the notion of giving generously to those in need is widely accepted deeply ingrained in our social fabric. However, when faced with the prospect of donating $5 to James who plans to use it for a final gamble, a logical flaw emerges. While the amount may seem trivial to those who can afford it, the potential consequences of supporting a habit with destructive tendencies must be carefully considered.

To begin with, the assumption that this audience, including myself, can comfortably spare $5 presupposes a certain financial stability. Yet, this very stability should prompt a critical evaluation of the intended use of the donation. If James plans to channel the funds into a final gambling spree, the act of giving transforms from a benevolent gesture, , what "real friends" do, to an unwitting endorsement of a harmful habit. It becomes imperative to question the ethics of contributing to an activity that has the potential to perpetuate a cycle of dependency.

Consider, for instance, a parallel scenario where a well-intentioned individual, Corey, hands a bottle of whiskey to a friend promising to quit alcohol after one last binge. The inherent contradiction in facilitating the very behavior one wishes to eliminate becomes apparent. In both instances, providing resources for a potentially destructive end contradicts the underlying principles of responsible giving.

Furthermore, the ambiguity surrounding the James's commitment to quitting gambling introduces a layer of uncertainty. If he emerges victorious in his last gamble, there is no guarantee that he will indeed abandon the habit. The temporary cessation might be overshadowed by the allure of newfound winnings, leading to a continuation of the very behavior the donation aimed to curtail. Analogously, it is similar to funding a reformed smoker's last cigarette with the hope that it will mark the end of their addiction, despite the absence of any concrete commitment to change-- a previous experience can be a counter-point.

A counter-argument may posit that the act of giving, regardless of the intended use, stems from a place of empathy and compassion between two friends. However, it is crucial to recognize that true compassion involves considering the long-term well-being of the friends suffering from the addiction. In this context, facilitating a potentially destructive behavior under the guise of kindness is a misguided approach. It resembles offering a struggling student an answer key to a test instead of providing the necessary tools for learning, ultimately hindering personal growth and development.

The logical flaw in donating $5 to James, or any other close friends in that matter, intending to use it for a final gamble lies in the inadvertent support of a harmful habit. While the amount may seem insignificant, the ethical implications of contributing to a potentially destructive behavior cannot be overlooked. Responsible giving involves a nuanced understanding of the consequences associated with our actions, promoting long-term positive change rather than enabling momentary indulgence.

As a friend concerned about your well-being and mindful of the potential negative consequences of contributing to your final gamble, I would like to propose an alternative solution that aligns with your goal of quitting gambling.

Instead of providing $5 for a last gamble, let us together explore ways to support your journey towards a gambling-free life. I suggest we redirect that $5 towards a more constructive purpose, such as investing it in a hobby or skill that brings you joy and fulfillment (that includes Smash, 2K, etc). This way, we can channel your energy and resources into activities that contribute positively to your overall livelihood.

Consider engaging in activities that not only provide a healthy distraction but also foster personal growth. Whether it's taking up a new hobby, enrolling in a class, or investing in materials for a creative project, redirecting the $5 towards constructive endeavors can be a small yet meaningful step towards breaking free from the cycle of gambling. A brief monetary gain (from a broader perspective) does not compare to the mental and physical shock that could affect the course of one's life.
